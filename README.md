This is an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) plugin that helps you do tracking in daily notes and represent the data comprehensively. Here are examples showing what you can track:

## Installation
### Install from Obsidian Settings Panel
1. From Settings Panel (the icon at the bottom left corner) -> Options -> Community plugins, set 'safe mode' to off.
2. In the 'Community plugins' section, click 'Browse' and find the obsidian-tracker plugin by the name 'Tracker'.
3. Press the button 'Install' and wait for the completion of the install.
4. In the section 'Installed plugins', find and enable the plugin just installed.
5. Enjoy tracking.

### Manual Installation
Download the latest [release](https://github.com/pyrochlore/obsidian-tracker/releases). Extract and put the three files (main.js, manifest.json, styles.css) to folder '{{obsidian_vault}}/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-tracker'.

## Usage
1. Have some targets you want to track in daily notes. Take a look at [Target Evaluation](https://github.com/pyrochlore/obsidian-tracker/blob/master/docs/TargetEvaluation.md) for what you can track and how targets are evaluated as numbers.
2. Add a new note for displaying the tracker.
3. Add tracker code blocks manually or using commands. See [Commands](https://github.com/pyrochlore/obsidian-tracker/blob/master/docs/Commands.md) for more detail.
4. Switch the document view mode to 'Preview', then the code block will get rendered.

For more use cases, please open the [examples](https://github.com/pyrochlore/obsidian-tracker/tree/master/examples) folder in obsidian with this plugin installed and enabled.

## Concepts
This plugin was designed to read code blocks in [YAML format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML). The key-value pairs in the code blocks tell the plugin what data to collect and how to represent the result.

[Here](https://github.com/pyrochlore/obsidian-tracker/blob/master/docs/InputParameters.md) are all the parameters (key-value pairs) defined in this plugin. They are used for collecting data, evaluating targets, data preprocessing, and rendering output.

### Collecting Data
Providing key '**searchType**' and '**searchTarget**' is the minimum requirement for a successful data collection. The value of the key '**searchType**' can be '**tag**', '**frontmatter**', '**wiki**', or '**text**' and the cooresponding '**searchTarget**' should be provided according to the specified type.

From version 1.3, you can provide multiple search targets by entering an array of targets separated by a comma. Each of the targets will be identified then the corresponding value will be evaluated and form a dataset indexed by the order in the array (zero-based indexing).

Multiple values under a target (value tuple) separated by a slash, e.g. #blood-pressure:180/120mmHg, are also got supported in version 1.3.0. To identify a specific value as a target, use bracket notation where the value in the bracket is the index by the order of values. In this case, they are blood-pressure[0] and blood-pressure[1]. You can find the example of this [here](https://github.com/pyrochlore/obsidian-tracker/blob/master/examples/BloodPressureTracker.md)

### Target Evaluation
Depends on the '**searchType**' and the '**searchTarget**' you provided, the evaluation of a target would be different. Simply speaking, you can track the occurrences of a target or the value attached/embedded in it.

To see the detail about the target evaluation, please check the document [Target Evaluation](https://github.com/pyrochlore/obsidian-tracker/blob/master/docs/TargetEvaluation.md).

### Rendering Output
Currently, obsidian-tracker provides three kinds of rendering output, the default one 'line' for a line chart, 'bar' for a bar chart and 'summary' for a text block. 

For 'line' or 'bar' output, the plugin will generate a customizable chart. For 'summary' output, a text block based on your '**template**' parameter will be generated. You can also use [pre-defined template variables](https://github.com/pyrochlore/obsidian-tracker/blob/master/docs/TemplateVariables.md) in the template.

Description for the chart and summary related paremeters can be found [here](https://github.com/pyrochlore/obsidian-tracker/blob/master/docs/InputParameters.md#parameters-for-common-chart) and [here](https://github.com/pyrochlore/obsidian-tracker/blob/master/docs/InputParameters.md#parameters-for-summary) respectively.

### Plugin Settings
You can set the default folder location and date format in the plugin's settings panel. You can also override them by key '**folder**' and '**dateFormat**' in the code block respectively.

| Setting Item | Description | Default | 
|:--------|:-------|:---------|
| Default folder location | The folder your daily notes reside | Root of the vault |
| Default date format | The date format of your daily note title | 'YYYY-MM-DD' | 

For more information about the dateFormat settings, check the [TestDateFormats example](https://github.com/pyrochlore/obsidian-tracker/blob/master/examples/TestDateFormats.md) and [moment.js string format](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/parsing/string-format/).
